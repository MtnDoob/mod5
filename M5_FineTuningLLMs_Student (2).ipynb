        "For this assignment, you will be comparing performance on a common language model benchmarking task: predicting the sentiment for the Stanford Sentiment Treebank ([SST-2](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html)). We will use the same model, [Flan-T5-Small](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-small), across all of our \"training\" methods so that the results are directly comparable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**TODO**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use your preferred method to select a sample of 2000 sentences from the train dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q**: After reading a little bit about the Sentiment Treebank project at the link above, and recognizing that the paper was written in 2013, what method do we now use to provide the same kind of benefit that they intended with their tree-based sentiment representations?\n",
        "\n",
        "**A**: The 2013 Stanford Sentiment Treebank paper addressed a fundamental limitation in earlier sentiment analysis systems: they treated sentences as bags of words, simply summing up positive and negative word scores while ignoring word order and compositional structure. This made them easy to fool with sentences like \"This movie was actually neither that funny, nor super witty,\" where positive words like \"funny\" and \"witty\" appear but the overall sentiment is negative due to negation and structure. The solution was to use Recursive Neural Networks that operated on syntactic parse trees, building up sentiment representations compositionally from smaller phrases to larger ones following the grammatical structure. This allowed the model to understand how words combine to create meaning at different levels of the sentence, properly handling negation, contrastive conjunctions, and other compositional phenomena, creating the Sentiment Treebank dataset with fine-grained labels for over 215,000 phrases in parse trees to train and evaluate these models.\n",
        "Today, we achieve the same benefits using Transformer models with self-attention mechanisms like BERT, T5, and GPT. Rather than requiring explicit parse trees, these models learn compositional semantics implicitly through layers of self-attention that allow each word to attend to and interact with all other words in context. The attention mechanisms automatically discover which words and phrases are relevant to each other, building up contextual representations that capture how meaning composes across the sentence, proving to be even more effective than explicit tree-based methods, eliminating the need for syntactic parsing while achieving superior performance on understanding how words combine to create sentence-level meaning."

        "One of the major benefits of today's generative models is that they can often be used effectively with no supervised, task-specific training (i.e. fine tuning). This avoids the time and expense needed to compile and train on a labeled dataset and is called zero-shot or few-shot prompting. However, using a generative model makes performance evaluation more complex, since the set of possible outputs is not pre-defined (i.e. the model can potentially produce any tokens in its vocabulary).\n",

        "**TODO**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Define a function to format zero-shot prompts. *HINT: Your prompt should introduce the labeling task (without providing an example), and end with an indication that it should respond.*\n",
        "- Define a function to format few-shot prompts using the examples provided. *HINT: This should be very similar to the zero-shot format, but with a couple example input/output provided.*\n",
        "- Define a function that will normalize the generated output for evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q**: Discuss one additional benefit and drawback to using a generative model with zero-shot or few-shot prompting in place of traditional supervised learning methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**A**: One major benefit of using zero-shot or few-shot prompting is the flexibility and speed of deployment. Unlike traditional supervised learning methods that require collecting thousands of labeled examples, training a model for hours or days, and then retraining whenever requirements change, prompting allows you to immediately adapt to new tasks or modify behavior simply by changing the prompt text. If you need to add a third sentiment category or change the output format, you can do so instantly without any retraining. This makes it particularly valuable for rapidly prototyping solutions, handling rare or niche tasks where large labeled datasets don't exist, or situations where requirements frequently evolve.\n",
        "However, a significant drawback is the lack of reliability and consistency in outputs. Traditional supervised models trained on specific tasks produce predictions from a fixed set of classes with well-calibrated confidence scores, making their behavior predictable and easier to validate. In contrast, generative models can produce arbitrary text outputs that may not match your expected format, requiring complex post-processing and normalization logic. The model might respond with \"I think this is positive\" instead of just \"positive,\" or use synonyms, or even refuse to answer in unexpected ways. This unpredictability makes it harder to achieve consistent high performance, more difficult to debug failures, and challenging to deploy in production systems that require reliable, structured outputs. Performance can also vary based on subtle prompt wording changes, introducing an additional layer of engineering complexity"

        "\n",
        "**A**: The results show both zero-shot and few-shot prompting achieved identical overall accuracy of 87.96%, which is surprisingly strong performance without any task-specific training. What's particularly interesting is that while the overall accuracy is the same, the confusion matrices reveal they make different types of errors. The zero-shot approach appears more balanced, with 373 correct negatives and 394 correct positives, showing relatively symmetric performance on both classes with 55 false positives and 50 false negatives.\n",
        "The few-shot method, despite having the same accuracy, shows a notable shift in error patterns. It correctly identified more negative examples (390 vs 373) but made more false negatives (67 vs 50), meaning it was more conservative about predicting positive sentiment. This suggests the few-shot examples may have influenced the model to be slightly more cautious, though the net effect on accuracy was neutral due to the offsetting improvement in negative classification. We usually expect few-shot prompting to outperform zero-shot, but here the model appears to already understand the sentiment classification task well enough from its pre-training that additional examples offered no benefit. This suggests Flan-T5 was heavily exposed to sentiment analysis during training. It's also worth noting that both methods achieved about 88% accuracy, which is quite respectable compared to the original 2013 paper's 80% baseline, showing how far pre-trained models have come in capturing this task without fine-tuning."

        "**A**:\n",
        "With a representative model like BERT, the training pipeline would change fundamentally in its architecture and objective. Instead of training a sequence-to-sequence model to generate text outputs like \"positive\" or \"negative,\" adding a classification head on top of BERT's encoder outputs and train it to predict one of two classes directly. The loss function would be categorical cross-entropy rather than the token-level generation loss used here, and you wouldn't need to tokenize target labels or use a data collator designed for generation. The model would output logits for each class, and you'd simply take the argmax to get predictions, eliminating the need for any text normalization or decoding steps.For supervised classification tasks like sentiment analysis, representative models like BERT make significantly more sense than generative models. BERT-style classifiers are more efficient because they only need a single forward pass through the encoder to produce a prediction, whereas generative models must auto-regressively generate each output token. They're also more reliable since they output structured probability distributions over a fixed set of classes rather than free-form text that requires normalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "The fine-tuned Flan-T5 achieved 88.76% accuracy, which is only marginally better than the 87.96% from zero-shot and few-shot prompting. This modest improvement after training on 2000 examples further illustrates a key point: generative models are powerful for their flexibility across tasks without fine-tuning, but when you have labeled data and a well-defined classification problem, a dedicated encoder model trained as a classifier would likely achieve better performance more efficiently. The generative approach adds unnecessary complexity for what is fundamentally a binary classification task."

        "\n",
        "**A**:\n",
        "The most surprising result is how minimal the performance differences are across all three methods. The zero-shot and few-shot approaches achieved identical 87.96% accuracy, and fine-tuning on 2000 labeled examples only improved performance by 0.8 percentage points to 88.76%. This suggests that Flan-T5's pre-training already equipped it with strong sentiment analysis capabilities, making it difficult to extract significant gains through either example demonstrations or supervised fine-tuning on this particular task and dataset size.\n",
        "The fact that few-shot prompting didn't outperform zero-shot is particularly interesting and counterintuitive. This could indicate that the task description alone is sufficient for the model to understand what's required, or that the two demonstration examples weren't diverse enough to provide additional value. It's also possible that the prompt formatting matters more than the examples themselves. The modest improvement from fine-tuning raises questions about whether 2000 examples is enough to meaningfully shift the model's behavior, or whether the learning rate and training hyperparameters could be better optimized.\n",
        "To improve prompting methods, experimenting with different prompt phrasings, adding more diverse few-shot examples covering edge cases like negation and contrastive conjunctions, or using chain-of-thought prompting to encourage reasoning could help. For fine-tuning, training on the full dataset rather than just 2000 examples would likely yield better results, and hyperparameter tuning of learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs could optimize the training process."
