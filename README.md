# Fine Tuning LLMs
With the advancement of generative AI comes a new method for applying models to specific tasks without supervised training. In this assignment, you will use a small, locally-hosted LLM (google/flan-t5-small) to evaluate performance on the SST‑2 sentiment classification benchmarking dataset. You will compare how the same model performs after:
1. Zero‑shot prompting
2. Few‑shot prompting
3. Fine‑tuning


## Instructions

1. Create a repository under your GitHub account from this template: [https://github.com/amarbut/ADS-509-mod5](https://github.com/amarbut/ADS-509-mod5). Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Make your repository [private](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility) and add your instructor’s GitHub account as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). 
2. Follow the provided Jupyter Notebook like a worksheet, completing all of the **TODO** items in the provided code cells and answering all of the written questions (marked **Q**) in the provided markdown cells. DO NOT create your own notebook or .py file from scratch, as this inevitably leads to missed instructions or questions and complicates grading.
3. When you have finished your code, print your notebook as a PDF and submit it in Canvas. 
4. Commit your code, push the changes to GitHub, and include a link to your repo in your Canvas submission note so your instructor has access to the .ipynb notebook files and any other code you create.
